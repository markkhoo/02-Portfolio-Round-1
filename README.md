# Portfolio-of-Mark-Khoo

## The Evolving Portfolio
This portfolio is a constant work-in-progress of mine and showcases the projects I am most proud of. If you haven't visited [my portfolio](https://markkhoo.github.io/Portfolio-of-Mark-Khoo/) already, there you could find a little information about myself, see some projects I have worked on, and links to socials. 

You are probably reading this through my [GitHub](https://github.com/markkhoo/Portfolio-of-Mark-Khoo) repository. I've made this whole website with VS Code and all of the assets, html, css, js files should be available to view in the repository.
